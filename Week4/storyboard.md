<h3> Reactions </h3>

Natasha: I liked the idea of including the conclusions in the navigation page, it helps explain our purpose as well. I also liked the clickable aspect of the sidebar to show the top 5 countries, it increases user interactivity.

<h3> Reactions </h3>

Alekhya:I like how every idea goes back to the central theme of user experience. I really like how you considered students and policy makers as part of the project as well. I like both options of sidebar and especially like the popups interaction which we could include in our project.

<h3> Reactions </h3>

Alekhya: I like the idea of using markers as circles to show the region. I also like the color coding that would take you to different regions on the map. 

Natasha: I liked the idea of color coding the different parts of the map, I think it helps add a good overall aesthetic to an otherwise boring map. It also helps include one more data/factor/characteristic? besides what the markers represent.

<h3> Reactions </h3>

Natasha:Oooo I like the idea of a year-slider scale. It might be hard to execute with all the information we’re including but I think it gives our map a good range so it’s more useful to users. I also like the fact that we could include details in the popup, it helps give meaning behind numbers.

<h3> Reactions </h3>

Alekhya: I like the markers to differentiate between average/low pollution levels and high level pollution. I also like the menu bar to help users navigate through the website.

<h3> Reactions </h3>

Alekhya: I like the feature to show/hide the sidebar. I also like the circles which are clickable and will redirect us to different regions on the map.

Natasha: Yes! I like that you can hide the sidebar, I think since our map will have a lot of information, it helps to be able to see it clearly without the sidebar sometimes. I also like the about us translucent popup on the whole page, it allows the users to know more about the purpose of the map without having to leave the page!
