# State-of-the-Arts
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<b>Group name:</b> State-of-the-Arts


<b>Description:</b> Our project will show the locations of iconic films around the world. As travel is slowly starting to reopen after the pandemic, we want to build a guide for film fanatics and tourists alike. These locations would help people learn about the cultures of different places and allow them to immerse themselves into the world of film. Travel and exploration is an important part of learning about a city's culture and we want to contribute towards this through our visual and interactive map.

|Hello! My name is Natasha and I’m a third year transfer student majoring in Business Economics and minoring in Digital Humanities. I don’t have a lot of coding experience as of right now, but I hope to be able to bring new creative perspectives to the team and learn along the way. I enjoy expressing myself creatively and believe web mapping (and this project) will expose me to a new way of doing that.|Hi! My name is Alekhya and I’m a fourth year majoring in Cognitive Science and minoring in Digital Humanities. I wanted to become more creative with coding and visualization of data. Through this project I hope to learn a new and creative perspective of analyzing data and learn web mapping skills as a way of storytelling.|Hi! My name is Zona (she/her) and I am a third year majoring in Design Media Arts and minoring in Digital Humanities. I also don’t know too much about coding, but through taking this course I hope to build some of my coding skills and explore more about web mapping. |

<h1>Overview</h1>
Through this project we will learn about the different kinds of films people watch around the world and the speciality of the locations these movies have been filmed in. Living in Los Angeles, we realize the importance of arts and film in our culture and we want to expand this knowledge by understanding other cultures. We also want to provide a guide for people visiting places so that they are able to delve deep into the film culture of the place they are visiting. This way we hope to reflect on the history of films and educate people on the culture of the land they are visiting through films.


<h1>Methodology</h1>
Web mapping is a unique way for us to showcase all the locations around the world where the most iconic films have been made. By using this medium, it allows viewers to fully immerse themselves into the space that they may only have seen in movies and on screen into something more tangible through visualizations. Adding pinpoints to the locations of these film sets on an interactive map helps the users better understand the environment of each individual movie including the resources the filmmakers had access to based on the surroundings. Simultaneously, it is a function that also features the most recognized scenes from a film, which can prompt the viewers to develop an interest towards further exploring these locations.
