			Introduction
		</h2>
		<p>
			Our project will focus on understanding where air quality is most detrimental to humans and the reasons behind these emissions. Through the use of web mapping and visual interaction, the viewers are able to get a better understanding of the direct harm that pollution has caused in our world today espeically within low income environments. We hope to open the eyes of users towards global warming, the reasons for climate change and the steps we all can take towards saving our planet.

	<h2>
		Overview 
	</h2>
			<p>
				Using geospatial data sets of different countries, our group focuses on mortality rates as a result of varying levels of air pollution. Household air pollution was responsible for 3.8 million deaths around the world (World Health Organisation, 2016). With the events of the coronavirus in the past year, it has become more important now than ever, to decrease the health risks we come into contact with everyday. The size of the public health threat that air pollution poses varies drastically according to a countryâ€™s level of development: in low- and middle-income countries, household air pollution is responsible for almost 10% of the mortality; globally, it is responsible for 7.7% of the global mortality. We feel that creating a visual location guide could help us gain a clearer understanding as to where air quality could be detrimental for most and the socioeconomic reasons behind it. Income levels are directly related to the access the country has to making environmental decisions (prioritising profits over less pollution) and then subsequently, how sheltered the people are to being exposed to these potential risks (healthcare, discrimination).

				How To Use The Map
			</h2>   
			<p>
				Using the buttons on the sidebar, view the choropleth layer for the varying pollution levels of each country. You can also view the red and green markers that show the death rates caused by these pollution levels.
				The graph that appears below the map as you view these pollution levels help further visualize the pollution trends over the years. The two giant blue arrows help narrow down the countries with the current highest and lowest mortality rates.
			</p>
			<br>
			<h2> Where Do We Go From Here? </h2>
			<p> We believe visualizing the death rates by pollution helps narrow down the sources of high pollution in specific countries. This also
				helps curate specific solutions that fit the country's socioeconomic situation. As pollution is not a one-size-fits-all, the solutions policymakers
				or environmentalists use to alleviate it shouldn't be either.

				The above graph shows a high correlation between GDP per capita (a measure of the country's development) and the deaths caused by pollution. Countries such as India show a high death rate and low GDP per capita, putting this together with the results
				we derived from our map, we understand the link between these factors even better.
