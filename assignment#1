Description: Our project will show the locations of iconic films around the world. As travel is slowly starting to reopen after the pandemic, we want to build a guide for film fanatics and tourists alike. These locations would help us learn about the cultures of different places and understand what kind of films were considered classics. Travel and exploration is an important part of learning about a city's culture and we want to revitalize the lost culture.

<h3>Overview</h3>
Through this project we will leanr about the different kinds of films people watch around the world and the speciality of the locations these movies have been filmed in. Living in Los Angeles, we realize the important of arts and film in our culture and we want to compare it with foreign countries. We also want to provide a guide for people visiting places so that they are able to delve deep into the film culture of the place they are visiting. This way we hope to reflect on the history of films and educate people on the culture of the land through films.
