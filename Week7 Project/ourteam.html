            Hello! My name is Natasha and 
            I’m a third year transfer student majoring in Business Economics and minoring in Digital Humanities. 
            I don’t have a lot of coding experience as of right now, but I hope to be able to bring new creative perspectives to the team and learn along the way. 
            I enjoy expressing myself creatively and believe web mapping (and this project) will expose me to a new way of doing that.
          </p>

              Hi! My name is Alekhya and I’m a fourth year majoring in Cognitive Science and minoring in Digital Humanities. 
              I wanted to become more creative with coding and visualization of data. 
              Through this project I hope to learn a new and creative perspective of analyzing data and learn web mapping skills as a way of storytelling.

              Hi! My name is Zona (she/her) and I am a third year majoring in Design Media Arts and minoring in Digital Humanities. 
              I also don’t know too much about coding, but through taking this course I hope to build some of my coding skills and explore more about web mapping.
