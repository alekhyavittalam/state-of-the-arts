			Introduction
		</h2>
		<p>
			Our project will focus on understanding where air quality is most detrimental to humans and the reasons behind these emissions. Through the use of web mapping and visual interaction, the viewers are able to get a better understanding of the direct harm that pollution has caused in our world today espeically within low income environments. We hope to open the eyes of users towards global warming, the reasons for climate change and the steps we all can take towards saving our planet.

		Overview 
	</h2>
			<p>
				Using geospatial data sets of different countries, our group focuses on the distribution of air pollution as a result of varying development levels across the world. Household air pollution was responsible for 3.8 million deaths around the world (World Health Organisation, 2016). With the events of the coronavirus in the past year, it has become more important now than ever, to decrease the health risks we come into contact with everyday. The size of the public health threat that air pollution poses varies drastically according to a country’s level of development: in low- and middle-income countries, household air pollution is responsible for almost 10% of the mortality; globally, it is responsible for 7.7% of the global mortality. We feel that creating a visual location guide could help us gain a clearer understanding as to where air quality could be detrimental for most and the socioeconomic reasons behind it. Income levels are directly related to the access the country has to making environmental decisions (prioritising profits over less pollution) and then subsequently, how sheltered the people are to being exposed to these potential risks (healthcare, discrimination). Keeping in mind that a richer nation could also be behind the low air quality of a poorer nation, focusing on income levels allows us to ensure that our project is inclusive of data sets from varying countries and does not exclude a richer/more developed country’s role as air pollutants.

				How To Use The Map
			</h2>   
			<p>
				The map shows the death rates caused by pollution in each country. The percentages have been categorized into high rates and low rates and have been color coded for easy identification. Click on a marker to find out more about the percentage of deaths due to pollution.
				On the sidebar, the top 5 countries with the highest death rates are displayed. Clicking on these buttons will take you to the country on the map.
