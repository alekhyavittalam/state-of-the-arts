# Week 8 Group Progress

### 1. Group name
State-of-the-Climate
### 2. Group members
Natasha Grace, Alekhya Vittalam, Zona Liao
### 3. In general, how is the group doing?
At the moment, our group has been updating the overall aesthetic of the website by working in css to make the pages appear more clean with a clear homepage and toolbar settings for each of the pages. We are making progress on our web mapping by updating the code and continuing to stick to our original weekly plan to get everything done by the end of the quarter.
### 4. What is the status of your code development?
In terms of the status for our code development, we have been keeping up with the labs and adding elements we learn in class into our climate change web mapping. We just added the choropleth layer to our code and from there we want to continue fixing the colors and look of the map. ur code could do with some fine-tuning and maybe inputing the data/some new additions we're still figuring out how to add. It's missing a few things we feel could add a lot more to our site. For example, making the "Top 5" feature a function that's coded in instead of manually. We are currently working on incorporating a timeline in our maproom. the map will update the information based on the year that is selected on the bottom. Our code is not too complex since we are all beginner coders, but I think online sources and the class assignments has been helping us with our coding for our project map; we will continue to enhance the map and the features on it in our code.
### 5. What (if any) specific problems do you need the most help with?
I think our other main problem right now is the lack of user interactivity and the clarity of how the data is being conveyed. There's also a little bit of a disconnect in the data we have and the facts we got from other sources but we should be able to fix it. On clarity of data, we wish to use circle radiuses (for the markers) to fix the issue and review the datasets we're using. 
### 6. What additional features are you thinking of adding to your project?
I think some additional features we are thinking about adding to our project would be altering the legend to make it fit our map style while also updating it to the timeline slidebar that is currently selected by the users. We also thought it might be cool to make our map a black and white one or make it a variation of the original leaflet map to match the style of our webpage design more. We also wanted to add popus to our map to show more in deth research on our project.
### 7. What other concerns do you have?
Some concerns we have us that our choroleth layer uses data from the year 2016 whereas our other data sources use data from the year 2017. We also found some missing values in our data which we need to fix. We wanted to showcase the top countries with highest and lowest pollution levels and that is something we are trying to work on. Our main concern is  the visualisation of the data, we want it to deliver our message as intended but we're afraid it might not be meaningful enough. It is a little hard for us to see it from our perspective because of how closely we've been working with the data so we'll have other people review it to see how users can interact with it. There's a lot to improve on in terms of the interactions on the site and the clarity of our purpose.
