    |Hello! My name is Natasha and I’m a third year transfer student majoring in Business Economics and minoring in Digital Humanities. I don’t have a lot of coding experience as of right now, but I hope to be able to bring new creative perspectives to the team and learn along the way. I enjoy expressing myself creatively and believe web mapping (and this project) will expose me to a new way of doing that.|Hi!

Through this project I hope to learn a new and creative perspective of analyzing data and learn web mapping skills as a way of storytelling.|Hi!
