<h1>Introduction</h1>
<b>Group name:</b> State-of-the-Arts


<b>Description:</b> "Death rates from air pollution are highest in low-income countries." - ourworldindata.org

We are interested in delving deeper into air pollution and finding the reasons as to why income level of countries is related to pollution emitted by them. Our project will focus on understanding where air quality is most detrimental to humans and the reasons behind these emissions. We hope to open the eyes of users towards global warming, the reasons for climate change and the steps we all can take towards saving our planet.

|Hello! My name is Natasha and I’m a third year transfer student majoring in Business Economics and minoring in Digital Humanities. I don’t have a lot of coding experience as of right now, but I hope to be able to bring new creative perspectives to the team and learn along the way. I enjoy expressing myself creatively and believe web mapping (and this project) will expose me to a new way of doing that.|Hi! My name is Alekhya and I’m a fourth year majoring in Cognitive Science and minoring in Digital Humanities. I wanted to become more creative with coding and visualization of data. Through this project I hope to learn a new and creative perspective of analyzing data and learn web mapping skills as a way of storytelling.|Hi! My name is Zona (she/her) and I am a third year majoring in Design Media Arts and minoring in Digital Humanities. I also don’t know too much about coding, but through taking this course I hope to build some of my coding skills and explore more about web mapping. |

<h1>Overview</h1>
Using geospatial data sets of different countries, our group focuses on the distribution of air pollution as a result of varying development levels across the world. Household air pollution was responsible for 3.8 million deaths around the world (World Health Organisation, 2016). With the events of the coronavirus in the past year, it has become more important now than ever, to decrease the health risks we come into contact with everyday. The size of the public health threat that air pollution poses varies drastically according to a country’s level of development: in low- and middle-income countries, household air pollution is responsible for almost 10% of the mortality; globally, it is responsible for 7.7% of the global mortality. We feel that creating a visual location guide could help us gain a clearer understanding as to where air quality could be detrimental for most and the socioeconomic reasons behind it. Income levels are directly related to the access the country has to making environmental decisions (prioritising profits over less pollution) and then subsequently, how sheltered the people are to being exposed to these potential risks (healthcare, discrimination). Keeping in mind that a richer nation could also be behind the low air quality of a poorer nation, focusing on income levels allows us to ensure that our project is inclusive of data sets from varying countries and does not exclude a richer/more developed country’s role as air pollutants. 


<h1>Methodology</h1>
Web mapping will allow us to visualize countries' carbon footprints and will also allow us to understand which countries emit more pollution. At one glance we will be able to simplify our research for it to be understandable to anyone. The goal of our project is for users to become more aware of climate change and web mapping is the best way to show how our planet is slowly dying due to emmissions from all over the world. We will be including other visulaizations in order to understand the reason behind air pollution, especially in low- and middle- income countries. The map will help users naviagte our findings and guide them towards understanding the goal and purpose of our research i.e. where air quality could be detrimental to most and the socioeconomic reasons behind it.
