        <h1>About the Map</h1>
        Using geospatial data sets of different countries, our group focuses on the distribution of air pollution as a result of varying development levels across the world. 
		Household air pollution was responsible for 3.8 million deaths around the world (World Health Organisation, 2016). With the events of the coronavirus in the past year, 
		it has become more important now than ever, to decrease the health risks we come into contact with everyday. The size of the public health threat that air pollution poses varies 
		drastically according to a country’s level of development: in low- and middle-income countries, household air pollution is responsible for almost 10% of the mortality; globally, 
		it is responsible for 7.7% of the global mortality. We feel that creating a visual location guide could help us gain a clearer understanding as to where air quality could be detrimental 
		for most and the socioeconomic reasons behind it. Income levels are directly related to the access the country has to making environmental decisions (prioritising profits over less pollution) 
		and then subsequently, how sheltered the people are to being exposed to these potential risks (healthcare, discrimination). Keeping in mind that a richer nation could also be behind the low air 
		quality of a poorer nation, focusing on income levels allows us to ensure that our project is inclusive of data sets from varying countries and does not exclude a richer/more developed country’s 
		role as air pollutants.
